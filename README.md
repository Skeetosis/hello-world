# hello-world
Hello-word mark two. back with vengeance.
I am trying to learn to code so I can improve my fincaial stabilty and my life. I intended to use github to shameless steal other peoples code and play with it. I do not intend to profit in way from the hing here. Eventually I hope to be wellread and certified in many different avenues of IT.
